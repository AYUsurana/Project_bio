# Surana

## Something about me:

Hi, my name is Surana. I'm a character from my life and I hope I'm a good one. I like "Fuze Tea" (mango chamomile), playing guitar and cooking traditional dishes. I also like to listen to music while working, think a lot about the universe, I love legos, sweets and soulful, and a same time, energrtic music. Also I work as a 1C Specialist in an international outsourcing company. Yeye

## My incredible skills:

1. I can assemble tables and chairs of these Finnish brands with one screwdriver when the instructions clearly indicate that a drill is needed. 
2. I can't pronounce the word "фиолетовый" the first time;
3. I may not notice what is happening around me when I start thinking a lot about life, the relationship of people, and about people themselves;
4. As a developer in the company, I can make any improvements to the database, create reports for the needs of the client and correct errors both in the database and in technical errors;
5. Moderately stress-resistant.
